# Dylan Girard - StreamChamp

## Project Description

Welcome to StreamChamp - a visual re-imagining of the popular Twitch.tv streaming platform. This application allows viewing of many top Twitch streamers, with full chat, follow, and subscription integration. Using the custom Django API back-end, users can follow and view their favorite streamers and discover new streamers.

This application uses Twitch's API to collect user data, and is built using React/Bootstrap. It also uses TwitchEmbed, an NPM package that allows embedding of any Twitch channel based on user ID. The project has a high focus on visual design, responsiveness, and accessibility.
