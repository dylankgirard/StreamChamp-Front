# Dylan Girard - StreamChamp

## Project Description

Welcome to StreamChamp - a visual re-imagining of the popular Twitch.tv streaming platform. This application allows viewing of many top Twitch streamers, with full chat, follow, and subscription integration. Using OAuth2, users will be able to use their own Twitch account to view their favorite streamers and discover new streamers.

This application uses Twitch's API to collect user data, and is built using React/Bootstrap. The project has a high focus on visual design, responsiveness, and accessibility.

## User Stories

**Minimum Viable Product Goals**

- As a user, I want to interact with a flashy, cool interface that fits into the Twitch aesthetic, because that's how I usually experience Twitch.
- As a user, I want to be able to view popular streams and my followed streams from Twitch, because I don't want to miss any of the streamers I usually watch.
- As a user, I want to authenticate my identity easily (or sign up easily) with Twitch, because who likes to fill out forms?
- As a user, I would like to be able to perform a simple search for streamers or games that I hear about, so that I can explore new Twitch experiences.

**Stretch Goals**

- Aside from chatting in Twitch Chat, I would like to have the ability to leave more substantial 'posts' on streamer timelines, so that I can share opinions and ideas with other users. This would probably require some kind of back-end authentication process specific to the app.
- As a user, I would love to be able to filter streamers with different viewership counts, because sometimes I like watching smaller streamers with less hectic chat rooms.
- As a user, I would like to have access to an about page with info featuring the creator of this app.
